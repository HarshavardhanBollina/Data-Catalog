Standardized Names & Codes: Kiss inconsistent place names and cryptic codes goodbye.
Harmonized Dates & Data Types: Ditch the format fights, dates and data speak the same language.
Consistent Variable Labels: Understand every data point at a glance with clear, standardized names.
Credible Data Aggregation: Merge reliable data from every level, from official reports to research findings.
Data Cleaning & Error Correction: No more head-scratching over conflicting numbers, inconsistencies ironed out.
Integrated Environmental Data: Analyze weather and climate's impact on the pandemic.
Population-Weighted Data: Understand how density influences the virus' spread.
Air Quality & Comorbidity Integration: Get a holistic view of risk factors.
Policy & Vaccination Tracking: Monitor government responses and vaccine progress.
Hidden Infection Estimates: Uncover the full picture beyond confirmed cases.
Augmented Data Fusion (future releases): Stay tuned for even more comprehensive data integration.
Epidemiological Insights: Generate estimates of infections and the "R number" to understand transmission dynamics.
Machine Learning Ready: Optimized data structure for powerful AI analysis.
Multiple Data Formats: Choose the one that fits your needs, including the lightning-fast fst format.
Coming Soon: Code to effortlessly load, combine, and subset the datasets.
This data catalog isn't just a collection of numbers; it's a meticulously crafted masterpiece of pandemic information, ready to fuel research, inform policy, and answer even the most complex questions about COVID-19.
